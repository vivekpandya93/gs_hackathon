README- Dynamic form made with pure HTML/CSS and Vanilla JavaScript


You can implement the component by placing js/form.js into a script tag and injecting the form.css file, and adding the "delete.png" into the project 

instatiate the following tags on the DOM: <dynamic-form></dynamic-form>

- The initial is an empty input box, and an input button.
- If the user enters input text to the box, clicking ADD INPUT enters the text to a list.
- The user can delete the list element by clicking the 'delete' icon.
- On form submit, the list elements are submitted as an array and can be viewed on the console.


This can be reused wherever on the DOM. 

Submitting a form results in the result of that specific form being submitted. Results of this can be seen on the console. 

An example is shown in index.html.
